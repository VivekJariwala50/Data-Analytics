# Project Overview
This project entails writing a program that accesses data from the stock market by way of the Alpha Vantage API, converting the data from a JSON format into a tabular format and querying this data. The emphasis is placed on the creation of SQL queries to obtain useful information and answer particular queries on the fluctuation in stock price, its variability, and trading volume.

# Data Source

API Provider: Alpha Vantage
Data includes the following fields: date, open, high, low, close, adjusted close, volume, and dividend amount.

# Steps in the Project

1. Data Extraction:
   Pulled stock market data from the Alpha Vantage API.
   Converted the raw JSON data into a structured table format.

2. Data Transformation:
   Organized data into a StockData table with appropriate columns for querying.
    
3. SQL Query Writing:
   Created and executed SQL queries to answer analytical questions related to stock market trends.

# Outcome and Insights

Progress:
Extracted, transformed, and analyzed stock market data using SQL queries.
Derived insights related to price movements, volume trends, and historical anomalies.

Next Steps:
Explore additional analytical questions.
Visualize findings using tools like Tableau or Power BI (optional).
